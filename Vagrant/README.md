# Vagrant Examples
Here are a handful of vagrant examples. The directory names should be self-explanitory for what each example is attempting to achieve. 

The general idea for any of these examples is to pull most of the config towards the top of the file in different Ruby variables for easy customization for your own projects.

I've stuck with the VirtualBox provisioner for most of these examples as well (should be easy to repurpose for other provisioning methods though).
